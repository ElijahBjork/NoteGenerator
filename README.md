# NoteGenerator

This is a small python program you can use to make fun notes for your friends. First, you create a note or fun image as a png with a white background. Then, you run the program. After selecting your new png file, you will select a point on each block of non-white pixels. The program will use a pathfinding algorithm to map every non-white adjacent pixel. After that, you are given the option to save a script that will automatically present the fun graphic on screen. Send that to a friend or family member to give them a nice treat!
